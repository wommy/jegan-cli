# jegan cli

## what do i need to build

- [ ] menu to select functions
	- [ ] new product

if no products
	new product
		quantity 0
		materials array
			new material
				quantity 0
			new material
				quantity 0

this needs serverless functions

could use localStorage

client side / server side

	upload file client side,
	put into table
	
this smells like alpine

	upload / create a file
	
	log
		new product
		new material
		new material

i need to go back over her material list
